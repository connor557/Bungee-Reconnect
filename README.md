Installation & Configuration

Bungee-Reconnect is a **BungeeCord plugin**! Just put it into the BungeeCord plugins folder, start/restart your server and the plugin will generate a configuration in the plugins folder.
Addition configs are available thanks to Terrobility.

Features
------
- Reconnect all players when a server restarts - you don't need an additional limbo server.
- Move the affected players to the fallback server or kick them from the proxy, if the server doesn't start within a specific time period again.
- Send titles and action bar messages (+ animated dots variable) to the players while they're waiting for the reconnect or if they got moved to the fallback server.
- Configure servers that are to be ignored by this plugin, custom messages, maximum amount of retries and many other things!
- Compatible with other BungeeCord plugins - its behavior isn't supposed to break anything at all!
- Provides an API for plugin developers.


API
------
Bungee-Reconnect provides a [**ServerReconnectEvent**](src/eu/the5zig/reconnect/api/ServerReconnectEvent.java).
If you're a developer and want to cancel the reconnect-process for any reason, you can just cancel this event.


Other
------
Officially tested with **Waterfall #146** and **Paper 1.12.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT #1217**.
This plugin supports (officially) **BungeeCord 1.12.2** and **Spigot 1.12.2**!
If you encounter any problems, please first make sure you update BungeeCord and Spigot before creating an issue report.
Under certain circumstances, this plugin might work with older versions, but we <b>don't</b> support it officially.
